# Safe Link Decoder
This is a project that I created to make it easier to retrieve the original URL from one that has been modified by Microsoft's Safe Links feature.

While this is not normally necessary, it can be helpful when troubleshooting issues caused by Safe Links, and for investigating suspicious domains. This is especially true for any URL with lots of encoded data.
